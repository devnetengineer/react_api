# API Form Submission App using React

The idea with this application is to take the field inputs and pass them in json payload in an API call

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
This installation step will take a look at package.json file's dependencies attribute and create node-modules folder where all the binaries will be installed.

## Update 2/28/24

The app works perfectly for making basic API calls-- however for more secure interactions that require an API key and specific request payloads, we need to tweak the fetch() parameters or consider using other libraries (eg., Axios)
